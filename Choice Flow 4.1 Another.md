# Now, now still, introducing the links here might be the wrong time to do it, but now forget about the API. Totally forget about the API. For this particular response, now focus, put your entire, entire focus on creating the best possible template that you can think of with the context that you know, without limiting yourself by whatever the API might limit itself to. Because as I said, the potential usage is so wide, this is just a speck of the dust in terms of where it can be applied. This is just a hookup, an add-on, which will be relevant not to you, but for Perplexity Labs. But your approach has to be maximal, maximal. Now go ahead, I think you've understood all of it. Generate the template for our MCQ protocol and what are we calling it? Okay, we're not, I'm not calling it anything. You can decide on a nice name. Decide on a nice name for that protocol. And yeah, just create it. Create it right away.

Certainly! Based on everything discussed, I am creating a comprehensive, flexible, maximal MCQ protocol template that embodies your vision of “The World is an MCQ” — a choice-based cognitive interface empowering users to drive AI collaboration through intuitive decisions rather than technical explanations.

# MCQ Protocol Template

### Protocol Name: **ChoiceFlow**

## 1. Overview

**ChoiceFlow** is a flexible, extensible protocol that structures complex interactions as a series of Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) presented in batches. It enables users to:

- Leverage cognitive strengths in pattern recognition and choice-making
- Provide informed decisions without requiring deep technical knowledge
- Navigate a wide range of domains, from strategic architectural decisions to granular UI preferences
- Maintain freedom to explore, justify, and morph their responses in natural, messy ways
- Preserve full contextual information throughout workflows to create meaningful AI-driven outcomes


## 2. Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Batch MCQs | Present multiple MCQs simultaneously rather than sequentially to enable holistic understanding and flexible user engagement |
| 3-5 Concrete Options + "Other" | Each MCQ offers 3-5 curated options plus an “Other” choice to cover unforeseen or user-defined answers |
| Messiness is Data | Users’ justifications, tangents, and iterative guesses are preserved as valuable context that informs AI interpretation and next steps |
| Context Accumulation | Every response, rationale, and metadata are accumulated throughout sessions to maintain a robust decision tree/context graph |
| Loose yet Defined Structure | Lightweight rules govern MCQ format (option count, tagging, response types) but allow full semantic flexibility based on topic, user expertise, and context |
| User Empowerment | Users are the ultimate drivers of choice; AI facilitates by shaping clear, meaningful options but never forces or preempts decisions |
| Domain \& User Agnostic | The protocol is independent of particular AI models, domains, or tooling, designed for maximal interoperability and extensibility |

## 3. MCQ Item Structure (Markdown-inspired)

```markdown
### MCQ [Unique ID: topic_subtopic_number]  
#### Question: <Clear, contextually framed multiple-choice question>  
##### Tags: #domain_category #difficulty_level #context_tag1 #context_tag2  

1. Option A: <Option text — concrete, outcome-oriented>  
2. Option B: <Option text — alternative direction>  
3. Option C: <Option text — another dimension of choice>  
4. Option D (optional): <Add if applicable>  
5. Other: <Open-text input / rationale / expansion>

##### Instructions:  
- Choose one or more options based on intuition and preference  
- Elaborate or justify your choice with freeform input if desired  
- Don’t hesitate to select “Other” and define your own alternative  
```


## 4. Metadata \& Response Handling

Each MCQ response bundle includes:


| Field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Selected Options | List of chosen options (numbers or keys) |
| Freeform Rationale | User’s justification, alternate ideas, context |
| Temporal Context | Timestamp to track when answers are given |
| Session Context ID | Identifier linking to overarching session context |
| Tags | Relevant tags aggregated from question/response |
| Confidence Level | Optional user-indicated confidence in choice |

## 5. Interaction Flow (Protocol Dance)

1. **Initialization**
    - Present batch of MCQs relevant to user goal and context
    - Provide clear instructions, option count, tags
2. **User Response**
    - User selects options, provides justifications/freeform inputs per MCQ
    - Responses are aggregated, with all messiness preserved
3. **Contextual Interpretation \& Storage**
    - AI ingests responses, updates session context \& intent model
    - Uncertainty or ambiguous answers are flagged for later refinement if needed
4. **Iterative Refinement**
    - New MCQ batches generated based on accumulated context and clarified user intent
    - User can re-examine prior answers freely; system supports non-linear navigation
5. **Final Synthesis**
    - Upon reaching a decision juncture or conclusion, AI generates final outputs (e.g., plan, code snippet, design, narrative)
    - User reviews and optionally loops back if needed

## 6. Tagging \& Contextual Dimensions

Every MCQ and response includes tags for:

- **Domain** (e.g., \#Architecture, \#UI, \#DataScience)
- **Difficulty** (numeric scale with predefined semantic mapping, e.g., 1 = Basic, 5 = Expert)
- **Contextual Modifiers** (e.g., \#Experimental, \#Conservative, \#UserPreferenceDriven)
- **Temporal** (snapshots, versioning)
- **User Profile/Style** (optional, to customize MCQ batches or option framing)


## 7. Flexibility \& Extensibility

- Number of options per MCQ may vary — minimum 3, ideally no more than 5 plus Other
- Responses may be single or multiple choice depending on MCQ design
- Freeform input encourages exploratory thinking alongside structured answers
- "Other" should be weighted equally in AI downstream processing
- Protocol supports merging overlapping MCQs or splitting complex ones
- Designed to power everything from chat-based interfaces to fully-fledged apps


## 8. Sample MCQ (Illustration)

```markdown
### MCQ [arch_ui_01]  
#### Question: Which overall style best fits your desired UI theme?  
##### Tags: #UI #Design #Difficulty_2 #UserPreference

1. Minimalist (clean lines, plenty of white space)  
2. Vibrant & Bold (bright colors, dynamic shapes)  
3. Classic (traditional layout, muted palette)  
4. Futuristic (neon, gradients, unconventional layouts)  
5. Other: ________________________

##### Instructions:  
Choose the style that resonates best with your vision. Feel free to explain your choice for better tailoring.
```


## 9. Naming Rationale

**ChoiceFlow** reflects the protocol’s core essence:

- **Choice**: User-driven decision nodes empower clarity and control
- **Flow**: Smooth contextual progression preserves freedom and adaptivity


# Summary

**ChoiceFlow** is the maximalist MCQ architecture template, capturing your vision of flexible, context-rich, user-empowering AI collaboration. It is domain-agnostic, supports complex contextual layering, and accommodates messy natural thinking — the perfect foundation for both template-driven AI interactions and app-based execution.

If you want, I can provide a fully annotated JSON/YAML schema version next or a sample interaction session scripted in this protocol to ground it further.
