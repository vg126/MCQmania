Model: Reka-Core MCQ Architecture Protocol Template
1. Protocol Rules

Batch Processing: Present 3-5 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) at once, along with an "Other" option to allow for flexible responses.
Mess-to-Intent Translation: Design the system to interpret and utilize user responses, including justifications and tangents, to refine subsequent questions.
Context Accumulation: Maintain a comprehensive log of all user interactions and responses to inform and personalize future question sets.
Bucket-Based Cognition: Frame MCQ options as recognizable patterns or categories rather than technical jargon to align with intuitive user thinking.

2. Interaction Patterns

AI Generation: The AI presents a batch of MCQs based on the current context or project stage.
User Choice: The user selects an option, provides additional context if desired, or chooses "Other" to input a custom response.
Context Accumulation: The system logs the user's choice and any additional information, updating the context for future interactions.
Next Generation: Using the updated context, the AI generates a new batch of MCQs to continue the decision-making process.

3. Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses: When a user selects "Other," the system prompts for a custom response, which is then analyzed to generate relevant follow-up questions.
Context Logging: Maintain a structured log of all user interactions, including questions presented, choices made, and additional user inputs.
Batch Sizing: Adjust the number of questions per batch based on user feedback and the complexity of the decision-making process.

4. Usage Examples

Code Architecture: 
Q: Which architectural pattern best suits this application?
A: Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless


(User selects "Microservices" and provides a rationale)


Creative Project:
Q: What mood should the opening scene convey?
A: Mysterious, Uplifting, Intense


(User selects "Mysterious" and adds a note about using ambient soundscapes)



5. Naming Convention
Cognitive Choice Navigation (CCN) Protocol
This name reflects the protocol's focus on guiding users through complex decisions by leveraging their cognitive strengths in pattern recognition and choice-making.

Conclusion
The Cognitive Choice Navigation (CCN) Protocol provides a structured yet flexible framework for enhancing human-AI collaboration by transforming complex decisions into manageable, choice-driven workflows. By adhering to this protocol, users can leverage their intuitive thinking processes while benefiting from the AI's ability to manage context and refine questions over time. This approach has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with AI across a wide range of domains.
