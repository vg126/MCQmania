Model: Llama-4-MaverickComprehensive MCQ Protocol Template
1. Protocol Rules

Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): Transform complex decision points into MCQs to facilitate intuitive decision-making.
Batch Processing: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, including an "Other" option, to preserve flexibility and prevent premature commitment.
Mess-to-Intent Translation: The system should accept and process varied user responses, including justifications, tangents, and stream-of-consciousness explanations, to extract genuine user intent.
Context Accumulation: Every user response, including justifications and tangents, should be logged and fed forward into subsequent generations to build a rich context log.
Bucket-Based Cognition: MCQs should be designed to trigger users' intuitive categorization, framing options as recognizable patterns or categories rather than technical terminology.

2. Interaction Patterns

AI Generation: The AI generates a batch of MCQs based on the user's input and accumulated context.
User Choice: The user selects their preferred options from the MCQs, providing justifications or tangents as needed.
Context Accumulation: The user's responses are logged and fed forward into the next generation of MCQs.
Next Generation: The AI generates the next batch of MCQs, taking into account the user's previous choices and accumulated context.

3. Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses: When a user selects "Other," they should be prompted to provide more detail. This detail can then be used to generate new options or refine existing ones.
Context Logging: All user responses should be logged and made accessible to the AI for future reference.
Batch Sizing: The number of MCQs presented in each batch should be determined based on the complexity of the decision and the user's cognitive style.

4. Usage Examples

Code Architecture Decisions: The AI could present MCQs about different design patterns, libraries, or frameworks, allowing developers to make informed choices based on their intuitive understanding of the problem.
Creative Projects: The AI could present MCQs about different themes, styles, or techniques, enabling artists and designers to explore different creative directions.
Business Strategy: The AI could present MCQs about different market segments, business models, or growth strategies, aiding business leaders in making informed strategic decisions.

5. Naming Convention
I propose the name "Cognita" for this protocol, reflecting its focus on leveraging users' cognitive strengths and intuitive decision-making abilities.
6. Dual Output Vision
The MCQ protocol should be implemented in two modes:

Template Mode: A markdown template that can be attached to any AI conversation to enable MCQ-style interaction.
App Mode: A dedicated application with APIs for seamless integration with various AI systems and platforms.
