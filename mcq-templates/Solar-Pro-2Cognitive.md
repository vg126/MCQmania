Model: Solar-Pro-2Cognitive Choice Navigation (CCN) Protocol
A Revolutionary Framework for Structured, Choice-Driven Human-AI Collaboration  

1. Protocol Rules
The CCN Protocol establishes a set of foundational principles to ensure effective, intuitive, and scalable human-AI collaboration:  

Batch Processing:  

Present 3–5 MCQs at once, including an "Other" option to allow for open-ended responses.  
Avoid sequential decision trees to prevent premature commitment and preserve cognitive flexibility.


Mess-to-Intent Translation:  

Accept and analyze user responses, including justifications, tangents, and stream-of-consciousness input.  
Extract actionable intent from "messy" inputs to refine subsequent MCQs.


Context Accumulation:  

Maintain a structured log of all user interactions, including:  
Selected MCQ options  
Free-form justifications and tangents  
Metadata (e.g., timestamp, decision phase)


Ensure zero loss of context throughout the collaboration.


Bucket-Based Cognition:  

Frame MCQ options as recognizable patterns or categories (e.g., "Mysterious," "Modular") rather than technical jargon.  
Align with intuitive thinking by avoiding overly precise or domain-specific terminology.


Tool-Agnostic Design:  

Work seamlessly in any AI interface (CLI, chat, app, etc.).  
Support both template-based and API-driven implementations.




2. Interaction Patterns
The CCN Protocol operates in a cyclical process of AI generation → user engagement → context update → AI refinement.  
Step 1: AI Generation

AI presents a batch of MCQs based on:  
Current context (e.g., project phase, user preferences)  
Accumulated interaction log


Example:  
Q: What architectural style best fits the project's scalability needs?  

A: Microservices  
B: Monolithic  
C: Serverless  
D: Hybrid  
E: Other




Step 2: User Choice

User selects an option or chooses "Other" and provides a custom response.  
User may include justifications, tangents, or additional context (e.g., "Microservices because the team is distributed").

Step 3: Context Accumulation

System logs:  
Selected option  
Any additional text input  
Metadata (e.g., time spent, decision confidence)


Context is parsed and indexed for future MCQ refinement.

Step 4: Next Generation

AI uses the updated context to generate a new batch of MCQs that:  
Drill deeper into the chosen topic  
Explore adjacent concepts suggested by tangents  
Adjust batch size based on complexity




3. Implementation Guidelines
Handling "Other" Responses

When "Other" is selected, AI prompts:  
"Please describe your choice or provide additional context:"  


Process the custom input to:  
Identify new patterns/categories  
Generate follow-up MCQs based on the input  
Update the context log with the new information



Context Logging

Maintain a structured log in JSON or markdown format, including:  {
  "batch_id": 1,
  "timestamp": "2024-05-22T10:00:00Z",
  "questions": [
    "What architectural style best fits the project's scalability needs?"
  ],
  "options": ["Microservices", "Monolithic", "Serverless", "Hybrid", "Other"],
  "user_response": {
    "selected_option": "Microservices",
    "justification": "The team is distributed, and we need independent deployments."
  }
}



Batch Sizing

Adjust the number of MCQs (3–5) based on:  
User preference (e.g., "I like fewer options to focus")  
Decision complexity (e.g., high-stakes choices may need smaller batches)  
Domain (e.g., creative projects may require broader exploration)
