Model: Inception-Mercury-CoderMCQ Protocol Template: "Choice-Driven Collaboration" (CDC)
1. Protocol Rules
1.1. Structural Framework

Batch Processing: Present 3-5 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) simultaneously, including an "Other" option to allow for open-ended responses.
Context Accumulation: Each user response, whether a selected option or an "Other" response, should be logged and used to inform subsequent questions.
Flexible Interaction: The protocol should adapt to the user's cognitive style and the complexity of the task at hand.

1.2. Interaction Patterns

AI Generation: The AI generates a set of MCQs based on the current context and the user's previous responses.
User Choice: The user selects one of the provided options or provides an "Other" response.
Context Accumulation: The AI logs the user's response and uses it to refine the next set of questions.
Next Generation: The AI generates a new set of MCQs based on the updated context.

1.3. Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses: When a user selects the "Other" option, the AI should prompt for a detailed explanation or additional information to clarify the user's intent.
Context Logging: Maintain a detailed log of all user responses and justifications to ensure that the AI can build a rich context for future questions.
Batch Sizing: Start with 3-5 MCQs per batch to balance the need for clear choices with the freedom to explore multiple options.

2. Interaction Patterns
2.1. Initial Interaction

AI: "Welcome to the CDC protocol. Let's start by addressing your primary goal. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response if none of these apply:
Define project scope
Identify key stakeholders
Set project timelines
Allocate resources
Other"



2.2. User Response

User: "I think we should first identify the key stakeholders."

2.3. Context Accumulation

AI: "Thank you. I've noted your preference to identify key stakeholders. Next, let's consider the roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Technical team
Project managers
Clients
Other"



2.4. Next Generation

AI: "Based on your previous response, we'll focus on identifying the key stakeholders. Here are some potential roles and responsibilities. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Decision-makers
Implementers
Advisors
Other"



3. Implementation Guidelines
3.1. Handling "Other" Responses

AI: "You selected 'Other'. Could you please provide more details about the role or responsibility you're considering?"
User: "I'm thinking of a compliance officer."
AI: "Thank you. We'll include the compliance officer in our list of key stakeholders. What else would you like to add?"

3.2. Context Logging

AI: "Logging your response: 'Identify key stakeholders' -> 'Compliance officer'. This will be used to inform the next set of questions."

3.3. Batch Sizing

AI: "To keep the process efficient and engaging, we'll present 3-5 options at a time. If you need more options, feel free to select 'Other' and provide additional details."

4. Usage Examples
4.1. Code Architecture Decisions

AI: "Let's start by defining the architecture of your new system. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Microservices
Monolithic
Serverless
Other"


User: "I prefer microservices."
AI: "Great choice. Now, let's consider the communication protocols between services. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
REST
gRPC
Message queues
Other"



4.2. Creative Projects

AI: "What is the primary goal of your creative project? Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Branding
Product design
Marketing campaign
Other"


User: "I'm working on a product design."
AI: "Excellent. Next, let's consider the target audience. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Consumers
Businesses
Other"



4.3. Business Strategy

AI: "What is the main objective of your business strategy? Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Market expansion
Cost reduction
Innovation
Other"


User: "I want to focus on innovation."
AI: "Innovation is a great goal. Now, let's consider the key areas for innovation. Please select one of the following options or provide an 'Other' response:
Product development
Process improvement
Customer experience
Other"

6. Template Mode
# Choice-Driven Collaboration (CDC) Template

## Introduction
This template is designed to facilitate structured, choice-driven workflows using Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). It is tool-agnostic and can be integrated into any chat interface.

## Protocol Rules
1. **Batch Processing**: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, including an "Other" option.
2. **Context Accumulation**: Log all user responses and use them to inform subsequent questions.
3. **Flexible Interaction**: Adapt to the user's cognitive style and the complexity of the task.

## Interaction Patterns
1. **AI Generation**: Generate a set of MCQs based on the current context.
2. **User Choice**: User selects one of the provided options or provides an "Other" response.
3. **Context Accumulation**: Log the user's response and use it to refine the next set of questions.
4. **Next Generation**: Generate a new set of MCQs based on the updated context.

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Handling "Other" Responses**: Prompt for detailed explanations when "Other" is selected.
2. **Context Logging**: Maintain a detailed log of all user responses.
3. **Batch Sizing**: Start with 3-5 MCQs per batch.

## Usage Examples
1. **Code Architecture Decisions**:
