Model: Mixtral8x22b-Inst-FWMCQ Protocol: A Comprehensive Template for Structured, Choice-Driven Human-AI Collaboration
Protocol Rules

Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): Every complex decision point is transformed into MCQs.
Batch Processing: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, not sequentially. This allows users to "grapple and grasp" across the problem space without getting locked into early choices.
Mess-to-Intent Translation: The system expects and handles users' "haphazard" responses, extracting genuine user intent.
Context Accumulation: Every user response, tangent, or justification is fed forward into subsequent generations, creating a rich context log of the user's actual thinking process.
Bucket-Based Cognition: MCQs should be designed to trigger users' intuitive categorization rather than requiring explicit understanding of technical terminology.

Interaction Patterns

AI Generation: The AI generates a batch of MCQs based on the user's input and the accumulated context.
User Choice: The user selects their preferred options from the MCQs, providing any necessary justifications or tangents.
Context Accumulation: The user's responses are logged and fed forward into the next generation of MCQs.
Next Generation: The AI generates the next batch of MCQs, taking into account the user's previous choices and the accumulated context.

Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses: If a user selects "Other", they should be prompted to provide more detail. This detail can then be used to generate new options or refine existing ones.
Context Logging: All user responses should be logged and made accessible to the AI for future reference. This ensures that the AI has a complete understanding of the user's thought process.
Batch Sizing: The number of MCQs presented in each batch should be determined based on the complexity of the decision and the user's cognitive style.

Usage Examples

Code Architecture Decisions: The AI could present MCQs about different design patterns, libraries, or frameworks, allowing the user to make choices based on their intuitive understanding of the problem.
Creative Projects: The AI could present MCQs about different themes, styles, or techniques, allowing the user to make choices based on their artistic vision.
Business Strategy: The AI could present MCQs about different market segments, business models, or growth strategies, allowing the user to make choices based on their understanding of the business environment.

Naming Convention
The MCQ Protocol could be called "ChoiceFlow" to reflect the idea of using choices to drive a collaborative, context-aware workflow.
This comprehensive template for the MCQ Protocol provides a flexible, scalable, and context-preserving framework for human-AI collaboration. It respects both parties' actual capabilities, allowing users to leverage their intuitive decision-making strengths while letting AI handle technical execution.
