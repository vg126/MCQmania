Model: Llama-3.1-NemotronMCQ Architecture Template: "ChoiceWeave" Protocol
Protocol Rules (Structural Framework)

Modular Design: Break down complex domains into manageable, interconnected modules.
Batch Processing: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously (with an "Other" option) to facilitate holistic understanding.
Context Accumulation: Store all user responses, justifications, and tangents to inform subsequent generations.
Tool Agnosticism: Design for compatibility with various AI systems and chat interfaces.
Scalability: Ensure the protocol adapts to simple and complex decisions, from micro to macro levels.

Interaction Patterns (AI Generation → User Choice → Context Accumulation → Next Generation)

Initialization:
AI presents an introductory prompt, outlining the domain and objective.
User provides initial context (optional).


MCQ Generation:
AI creates a batch of 3-5 MCQs based on the current context.
Each question includes:
Clear Stem: Concise, jargon-free question.
Bucket-Based Options: 3-4 recognizable patterns + "Other".




User Response:
User selects an option and provides justification (stream-of-consciousness, tangents, etc.).
"Other" selections trigger an open-ended prompt for user clarification.


Context Accumulation & Analysis:
AI logs user responses, integrating them into the context log.
AI analyzes the accumulated context to refine subsequent MCQ generations.


Iteration & Refinement:
Steps 2-4 repeat, with the AI adapting MCQs based on the evolving context.
User can request to revisit previous decisions or explore alternative paths.



Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses:
Trigger an open-ended prompt for user clarification.
Integrate the response into the context log, informing future MCQ generations.


Context Logging:
Store all user interactions, including justifications and tangents.
Utilize this log to refine MCQs and maintain contextual understanding.


Batch Sizing (3-5 MCQs):
Adjust based on user feedback and domain complexity.
Ensure batches remain manageable, preventing overwhelm.



Usage Examples Across Different Domains

Code Architecture:
MCQ: "Which database structure best fits your project's scalability needs?"
Options: Relational, NoSQL, Graph Database, Other


Creative Project:
MCQ: "What color palette aligns with your brand's desired emotional response?"
Options: Monochromatic, Complementary, Analogous, Other


Business Strategy:
MCQ: "Which market expansion strategy suits your company's current resources?"
Options: Horizontal Integration, Vertical Integration, Diversification, Other



Naming Convention
ChoiceWeave Protocol: Emphasizing the interwoven nature of user choices, context accumulation, and AI-driven insights.
