Model: Hermes-3-70BMCQ Protocol Template: A Comprehensive Framework for Human-AI Collaboration
1. Protocol Rules

Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): Transform complex decision points into MCQs, enabling intuitive navigation through complex domains.
Batch Processing: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, including an "Other" option, to maintain flexibility and prevent premature commitment.
Mess-to-Intent Translation: Accept and process varied user responses, such as justifications and tangents, to extract genuine intent.
Context Accumulation: Continuously update a context log with every user interaction, ensuring no loss of information.
Bucket-Based Cognition: Frame options as recognizable patterns or categories, avoiding technical jargon to align with user intuition.

2. Interaction Patterns

AI Generation: AI generates MCQs based on accumulated context and user input, ensuring relevance and alignment with user needs.
User Choice: Users select from the presented MCQs, providing additional context or selecting "Other" to express unique perspectives.
Context Accumulation: User responses, including justifications and tangents, are logged and used to refine future MCQs.
Next Generation: AI uses the updated context to generate new MCQs, maintaining a dynamic and evolving decision-making process.

3. Implementation Guidelines

Handling "Other" Responses: Prompt users to elaborate when choosing "Other," integrating their insights into subsequent MCQ generations.
Context Logging: Maintain a comprehensive context log that captures all user interactions, ensuring continuity and depth of understanding.
Batch Sizing: Adjust the number of MCQs based on complexity and user preference, allowing for both broad exploration and focused decision-making.

4. Usage Examples

Code Architecture Decisions: Use MCQs to explore different design patterns or technologies, enabling developers to make informed choices without deep technical dives.
Creative Projects: Apply MCQs to explore themes or styles, helping artists and designers refine their creative vision collaboratively with AI.
Business Strategy: Utilize MCQs to assess market opportunities or business models, aiding in strategic decision-making with AI-assisted insights.
