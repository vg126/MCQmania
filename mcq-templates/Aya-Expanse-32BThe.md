Model: Aya-Expanse-32BThe ChoiceCraft Protocol: A Template for MCQ-Driven AI Collaboration
This document outlines the ChoiceCraft Protocol, a revolutionary approach to AI collaboration designed to transform complex decision-making into intuitive, structured workflows through Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs).
1. Protocol Rules

Batch Presentations:  Present users with batches of 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, each with clearly framed options representing recognizable patterns or categories. Include an "Other" option to capture unique perspectives.

Mess-to-Intent Translation: Encourage "messy" responses – justifications, tangents, stream-of-consciousness explanations – understanding that these contain valuable user intent.

Context Accumulation:  Every user response, regardless of format, is meticulously logged and used to inform subsequent MCQ generations. This ensures a dynamic, evolving understanding of the user's thought process.

Bucket-Based Cognition: Frame MCQ options using intuitive language and recognizable patterns, leveraging the user's natural tendency for categorical thinking.

Scalability & Flexibility: The protocol should adapt to decisions of varying complexity, from simple choices to intricate architectural designs, and be applicable across diverse domains (code architecture, creative projects, business strategy, etc.).

Tool Agnostic:  The ChoiceCraft Protocol is designed to function with any AI system or chat interface, ensuring broad accessibility.


2. Interaction Patterns
The ChoiceCraft interaction follows a dynamic "dance":

AI Generation: The AI presents a batch of MCQs based on the current context and user goals.

User Choice: The user selects one or more options from the MCQs, potentially providing additional context through "messy" explanations.

Context Accumulation: The AI analyzes the user's choices and incorporates all accompanying explanations into the evolving context log.

Next Generation: Based on the enriched context, the AI generates a new batch of MCQs, refining the decision-making process.


This iterative process continues until the desired outcome is achieved.
3. Implementation Guidelines

"Other" Response Handling: When a user selects "Other," prompt them for a detailed explanation. Analyze this response to update the context log and potentially generate new MCQ options incorporating the user's unique perspective.

Context Logging: Implement a robust system for logging all user responses, both chosen MCQs and free-form explanations. This context log should be readily accessible to the AI for future reference.

Batch Sizing:  Aim for batches of 3-5 MCQs to provide sufficient choice without overwhelming the user. Adjust batch size based on the complexity of the decision and user preference.


4. Usage Examples

Code Architecture:

Present MCQs regarding design patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM), data structures (arrays, linked lists), or library selections based on project requirements.


Creative Projects:

Offer MCQs on genre, aesthetic style, character archetypes, or plot twists to stimulate creative decision-making.


Business Strategy:

Pose MCQs about target audience segmentation, marketing channels, product features, or expansion strategies, guiding strategic planning.



5. Naming Convention
ChoiceCraft: This name emphasizes the protocol's focus on crafting decisions through informed choices while highlighting the core element of MCQs.
6. Future Development (App Mode)
The ChoiceCraft Protocol is envisioned as both a template for immediate implementation and a foundation for a dedicated application. This app would offer:

Seamless Integration: APIs for easy integration with various AI platforms and workflow tools.
User-Friendly Interface:  Intuitive design catering to both technical and non-technical users.
Advanced Context Management: Sophisticated context logging and analysis for deeper understanding of user decision-making processes.
Personalization: Customizable MCQ generation based on user profiles, preferences, and past decisions.
