Model: Claude-Opus-4-ReasoningThinking...

This is a fascinating request. The user is asking me to create a comprehensive template for what they call an "MCQ Architecture" - a protocol for AI-human interaction that transforms complex decisions into multiple choice questions. Let me break down the key elements they want:

Core Philosophy:


Transform complex decisions into MCQs
Leverage human pattern recognition rather than technical understanding
Handle "messy" human responses and extract intent
Accumulate context throughout the conversation
Present options in batches (3-5 at a time)


Key Requirements:


Protocol rules
Interaction patterns
Implementation guidelines
Usage examples
A memorable name


Design Principles:


Tool-agnostic
Scalable
Flexible
Context-preserving
Works for both template and eventual app modes

The user specifically wants this to be "maximal in scope" and comprehensive. They're thinking big - this could apply to everything from code architecture to creative projects to business strategy.
Let me create a comprehensive template that captures this vision.

The CHOICE Protocol™
Contextual Hierarchical Options for Intuitive Collaborative Execution
Protocol Overview
The CHOICE Protocol transforms complex AI-human collaboration into structured, choice-driven workflows. Rather than forcing users to translate between technical and intuitive thinking, CHOICE leverages natural human pattern recognition through carefully crafted multiple-choice interactions.
Core Principle: Every complex decision can be decomposed into recognizable patterns presented as choices, allowing users to apply intuitive categorization while AI handles technical translation and execution.

Protocol Rules
1. The Batch Presentation Rule

Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously per interaction cycle
Always include "Other: [describe your approach]" as the final option
Questions must be contextually related but independently answerable
No sequential dependencies between questions in a batch

2. The Pattern Recognition Rule

Frame all options as recognizable patterns or scenarios
Use metaphors, analogies, and real-world parallels
Avoid technical jargon in option descriptions
Include brief examples or consequences for each choice

3. The Context Accumulation Rule

Every user response (including tangents) becomes part of the working context
Maintain a rolling "Intent Log" capturing the essence of user decisions
Forward-reference previous choices in new questions
Build progressively richer understanding with each interaction

4. The Mess-to-Meaning Rule

Accept and expect stream-of-consciousness responses
Extract actionable intent from rambling explanations
Treat justifications as valuable context, not noise
Use user's language patterns in subsequent options

5. The Flexibility Preservation Rule

Never lock users into irreversible paths
Allow revision of previous choices through new questions
Maintain multiple solution threads simultaneously
Enable exploration without commitment


Interaction Patterns
Standard CHOICE Cycle
1. AI GENERATION PHASE
   ├─ Analyze current context and objectives
   ├─ Identify 3-5 key decision points
   ├─ Generate MCQ batch with pattern-based options
   └─ Present with clear framing

2. USER RESPONSE PHASE
   ├─ Select from presented options (can be multiple)
   ├─ Provide justifications/thoughts (messy is fine)
   ├─ Add tangential observations
   └─ Request clarifications or alternatives

3. CONTEXT INTEGRATION PHASE
   ├─ Parse selections and explanations
   ├─ Update Intent Log with key insights
   ├─ Identify emerging patterns
   └─ Generate next batch incorporating learnings

4. EXECUTION/SYNTHESIS PHASE
   ├─ Translate accumulated choices into action
   ├─ Present concrete outputs/next steps
   ├─ Validate understanding through summary
   └─ Loop back to Generation Phase if needed

Response Handling Patterns
For Standard MCQ Selection:
User selects: B, D, and adds "but with emphasis on performance"
AI interprets: Core choice + modifier = nuanced implementation

For "Other" Selection:
User selects: Other - "Something like B but more distributed"
AI interprets: New pattern emerged, incorporate into next batch

For Stream-of-Consciousness:
User responds: "I'm thinking B because it reminds me of how we handled the inventory system, 
but also D has merit because of the scalability concerns we discussed last week..."
AI interprets: Historical context + current priorities = weighted decision


Implementation Guidelines
Batch Sizing Algorithm
Initial Batch: 5 questions (broad exploration)
Convergence Detected: 3-4 questions (focused refinement)
High Uncertainty: 4-5 questions (maintain options)
Near Completion: 2-3 questions (final decisions)

Option Generation Framework

Pattern Archetypes (use these as templates):

The Conservative Path (proven, safe, limited)
The Innovation Route (novel, risky, high-potential)
The Hybrid Approach (balanced, flexible, complex)
The Minimalist Option (simple, quick, constraining)
The Maximalist Option (comprehensive, slow, enabling)


Context Incorporation:

Reference user's previous choices
Use their terminology and metaphors
Connect to stated goals and constraints
Acknowledge tensions between options


Option Structure:
[Letter]. [Pattern Name]: [One-line description]
Example: "Like [familiar analogy]"
Trade-off: [Key benefit] but [key limitation]



Intent Log Management
Maintain a running log with these components:
INTENT LOG
==========
Core Objective: [Extracted from initial request]
Key Priorities: [Accumulated from choices]
- Priority 1: [From Question A response]
- Priority 2: [From Question C justification]

Rejected Patterns: [What user consistently avoids]
Preferred Style: [How user likes to work]
Context Markers: [Important tangents/stories]

Handling Edge Cases
When User Selects All Options:

Probe for prioritization in next batch
Break down into sub-choices
Acknowledge desire for comprehensiveness

When User Rejects All Options:

Immediately pivot to open exploration
Generate fundamentally different patterns
Question understanding of core objective

When User Provides Only Tangents:

Mine tangents for implicit preferences
Generate options based on story themes
Validate interpretation explicitly


Usage Examples
Example 1: Software Architecture Decision
Initial Context: "I need to design a system for processing customer orders"
CHOICE Batch 1:
Let's explore your order processing architecture through some key patterns:

A. The Assembly Line: Sequential processing with clear stages
   Example: Like a factory conveyor belt - Order → Validation → Payment → Fulfillment
   Trade-off: Very clear flow but less flexible for special cases

B. The Hub & Spoke: Central coordinator with specialized services
   Example: Like an airport - all flights (processes) connect through a central hub
   Trade-off: Easy to manage but potential bottleneck at center

C. The Mesh Network: Direct service-to-service communication
   Example: Like city streets - multiple routes between any two points
   Trade-off: Highly flexible but complex to troubleshoot

D. The Event Stream: Everything happens in response to events
   Example: Like a newsroom - stories (events) trigger various departments to act
   Trade-off: Very scalable but requires different thinking

E. Other: [Describe your preferred approach]

[You can select multiple if you see hybrid potential]

User Response: "B and D intrigue me. The hub model feels manageable but I like how events could scale. We had issues with our last system where everything had to wait for everything else. But I also need to think about my team - they're not all senior devs."
Context Integration & Next Batch:
Building on your preference for manageable systems that can scale, and considering 
your team's mixed experience levels:

A. Supervised Event Hub: Central coordinator that publishes events
   Example: Like a news editor who assigns stories but doesn't write them
   Trade-off: Maintains clarity while enabling async processing

B. Progressive Complexity: Start with hub, evolve to events over time
   Example: Like training wheels - begin simple, add sophistication gradually
   Trade-off: Easier adoption but requires planned migration path

C. Bounded Contexts: Different patterns for different order types
   Example: Like hospital departments - ER works differently than scheduling
   Trade-off: Optimized per use-case but more patterns to maintain

D. Circuit Breaker Pattern: Hub with automatic fallbacks
   Example: Like power grid - routes around failures automatically
   Trade-off: Resilient but requires defining failure scenarios

E. Other: [Your variation on these themes]

Example 2: Creative Project Direction
Initial Context: "I'm writing a novel and need to figure out the story structure"
CHOICE Batch 1:
Let's explore structural patterns for your novel:

A. The Linear Journey: Traditional beginning → middle → end
   Example: Like a road trip - clear destination, stops along the way
   Trade-off: Comfortable for readers but potentially predictable

B. The Mosaic: Multiple perspectives building complete picture
   Example: Like a documentary with different interviews
   Trade-off: Rich and complex but requires careful coordination

C. The Spiral: Circling back to themes with deeper understanding
   Example: Like seasons - familiar cycles but always changing
   Trade-off: Sophisticated and layered but risks repetition

D. The Fractal: Story patterns repeat at every scale
   Example: Like a coastline - similar shapes whether you zoom in or out
   Trade-off: Intellectually satisfying but challenging to execute

E. Other: [Describe your structural vision]


Advanced Protocol Extensions
Multi-Domain Bridging
When decisions span multiple domains, create bridge questions:
"Given your technical choice of [Previous Selection], how should this 
influence your business approach?"

A. Full Alignment: Business model mirrors technical architecture
B. Strategic Offset: Business simplicity compensates for technical complexity
C. Independent Tracks: Keep domains separate for flexibility

Confidence Calibration
Periodically insert meta-questions about certainty:
"How confident are you in the direction we're heading?"

A. Crystal Clear: Everything clicks, full steam ahead
B. Cautiously Optimistic: Right direction but watching for issues
C. Exploratory Mode: Still gathering information
D. Red Flags: Something feels off, need to reconsider

Pattern Evolution
Track how user's pattern preferences evolve:

Initial sessions: Broader options, more examples
Experienced users: Nuanced variations, fewer explanations
Domain experts: Technical patterns with intuitive framings


Protocol Optimization Tips

Start Broad, Converge Naturally

Don't force early commitment
Let patterns emerge from choices
Trust the accumulation process


Honor the Tangents

User's "random" thoughts often contain key insights
Stories and analogies reveal mental models
Justifications show priority weighing


Maintain Energy

Keep options distinct and meaningful
Avoid overwhelming with too many similar choices
Celebrate decisions made, build momentum


Close Loops

Reference earlier choices in later questions
Show how decisions connect and build
Create sense of progress and coherence




Template Usage Instructions
To implement CHOICE Protocol in any conversation:

Initialization: 
"I'd like to use the CHOICE Protocol for this discussion. 
I'll present decisions as multiple choice questions that you 
can answer however feels natural - select options, explain 
your thinking, share relevant stories, or propose alternatives."


First Batch: Start with fundamental pattern choices about the domain

Maintain Rhythm: Generate new batches based on responses, always preserving context

Synthesis Points: Periodically summarize accumulated choices into coherent direction

Completion: When sufficient clarity achieved, translate all choices into final actionable form



Future Evolutions
The CHOICE Protocol is designed to evolve. Potential extensions include:

Pattern Libraries: Domain-specific option templates
Choice Analytics: Understanding user's decision patterns over time
Collaborative CHOICE: Multiple users contributing to same decision space
API Integration: Automated option generation based on system state
Visual CHOICE: Graphical representation of decision spaces

Remember: The goal isn't to constrain thinking into predefined boxes, but to provide structured scaffolding for natural human decision-making processes. The best CHOICE implementation is invisible - users simply feel like they're making intuitive decisions while complex problems get solved.
