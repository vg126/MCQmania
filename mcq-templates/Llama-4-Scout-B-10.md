**MCQ Protocol Template: Comprehensive Framework for Structured, Choice-Driven Human-AI Collaboration**

**Introduction**

The MCQ Protocol is a revolutionary approach to AI collaboration that transforms complex domains into structured, choice-driven workflows. This comprehensive template provides a flexible and scalable framework for human-AI collaboration, leveraging users' intuitive decision-making strengths while letting AI handle technical execution.

**Protocol Rules**

1. **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**: Every complex decision point is transformed into MCQs.
2. **Batch Processing**: Present 3-5 MCQs simultaneously, not sequentially, to preserve freedom to explore the problem space.
3. **Mess-to-Intent Translation**: The system expects and handles users' "haphazard" responses, extracting genuine user intent.
4. **Context Accumulation**: Every user response, tangent, or justification is fed forward into subsequent generations, creating a rich context log.
5. **Bucket-Based Cognition**: MCQs trigger users' intuitive categorization, framing options as recognizable patterns rather than technical terminology.

**Interaction Patterns**

1. **AI Generation**: The AI generates a batch of MCQs based on the user's input and accumulated context.
2. **User Choice**: The user selects their preferred options, providing justifications or tangents as needed.
3. **Context Accumulation**: The user's responses are logged and fed forward into the next generation of MCQs.
4. **Next Generation**: The AI generates the next batch of MCQs, taking into account the user's previous choices and accumulated context.

**Implementation Guidelines**

1. **Handling "Other" Responses**: If a user selects "Other", they should be prompted to provide more detail, which can then be used to generate new options or refine existing ones.
2. **Context Logging**: All user responses should be logged and made accessible to the AI for future reference.
3. **Batch Sizing**: The number of MCQs presented in each batch should be determined based on the complexity of the decision and the user's cognitive style.

**Usage Examples**

1. **Code Architecture Decisions**: The AI could present MCQs about different design patterns, libraries, or frameworks, allowing the user to make choices based on their intuitive understanding of the problem.
2. **Creative Projects**: The AI could present MCQs about different themes, styles, or techniques, allowing the user to make choices based on their artistic vision.
3. **Business Strategy**: The AI could present MCQs about different market segments, business models, or growth strategies, allowing the user to make choices based on their understanding of the business environment.

**Naming Convention**

The MCQ Protocol could be called "Cognita" to reflect its focus on leveraging users' cognitive strengths and intuitive decision-making abilities.

**Dual Output Vision**

The MCQ Protocol should work in two modes:

1. **Template Mode**: A markdown template that can be attached to any AI conversation to enable MCQ-style interaction.
2. **App Mode**: A dedicated application with APIs for seamless integration with various AI systems and platforms.

**Technical Context & Integration**

The MCQ Protocol is designed to be:

* **Tool-agnostic**: Works in any chat interface or AI system.
* **Scalable**: From simple decisions to complex architecture choices.
* **Flexible**: Adapts to topic, user style, and project needs.
* **Context-preserving**: Maintains full conversation state.

This comprehensive template provides a maximal framework for the MCQ Protocol, unencumbered by technical constraints. It has the potential to be applied to a wide range of applications, from code architecture decisions to creative projects and business strategy.
