# Now, now still, introducing the links here might be the wrong time to do it, but now forget about the API. Totally forget about the API. For this particular response, now focus, put your entire, entire focus on creating the best possible template that you can think of with the context that you know, without limiting yourself by whatever the API might limit itself to. Because as I said, the potential usage is so wide, this is just a speck of the dust in terms of where it can be applied. This is just a hookup, an add-on, which will be relevant not to you, but for Perplexity Labs. But your approach has to be maximal, maximal. Now go ahead, I think you've understood all of it. Generate the template for our MCQ protocol and what are we calling it? Okay, we're not, I'm not calling it anything. You can decide on a nice name. Decide on a nice name for that protocol. And yeah, just create it. Create it right away.

Absolutely. Based on all your prior context, here’s a flexible, powerful, and maximally extensible template for your MCQ-centric decision protocol—expressed for clarity, generalizability, and practical handoff to humans or AIs, Labs or apps.

### Protocol Name Suggestion

**MCQ Nexus Protocol**
(Conveys both a central hub for structured choices and the connecting "nodes" of decision branching and integration.)

# MCQ Nexus Protocol Template

**Purpose:**
Convert complex, open-ended technical, strategic, or creative domains into a sequence/batch of structured multi-choice junctures enabling high-level pattern recognition and decision-making—even by non-technical users—without translation into technical jargon.

**Domains:**
Universal—can be applied in technology, coding, design, research, product management, workflow automation, creative brainstorming, etc.

## 1. Core Protocol Principles

- **Batch Over Sequential:**
Present users with a batch (default: 3–5) of MCQs simultaneously, minimizing forced early commitments and maximizing cross-context insight.
- **Flexible MCQ Structure:**
Each MCQ contains 3–4 context-relevant options **plus a required "Other/Custom" freeform response** (to capture edge knowledge, intent, or unknowns).
- **Messiness Captured:**
All user responses (choice selections, rationales, tangents, hesitations, etc.) are preserved in context for downstream synthesis.
- **Contextual Accumulation:**
Each generation of MCQs factors in all previous answers, comments, and procedural state. Nothing is ever dropped.
- **Intent Recognition:**
The system interprets *what is said and how it is said* (indirect, messy, or noncommittal responses) as valuable signal, not noise.
- **Topic Agnostic:**
The protocol is not prescriptive about domain and adapts to any chosen subject/flow.


## 2. User Interaction Template (Markdown/JSON)*

> *This is a generic structure, easily adapted to a UI spec, prompt framework, chat context, or app codebase.*

### ```markdown

# [MCQ Nexus Protocol Interaction Block]

## [Batch n]: Decision Context: *(Summary of current batch context)*

### MCQ1: [Short, plain-language question expressing the key decision point]

- [ ] **A.** [Option A: concise, distinct, non-jargon]
- [ ] **B.** [Option B: ...]
- [ ] **C.** [Option C: ...]
- [ ] **D.** [Option D: ...] *(optional; can be omitted)*
- [ ] **Other / Custom Response:** [Freeform text box]

➔ **Optional Rationale**: (Why did you choose your answer? Anything else you want to add about this decision?)

---

### MCQ2: [Next decision point]

- [ ] ...
...

---

*Repeat as many MCQs as batch requires (default: 3–5, can be tuned).*

---

## [Flexible Notes Section]

*Additional thoughts, links, concerns, uncertainties, or clarifications about any MCQ above. Anything you want recorded as context.*

---

## [Meta-Tags] *(hidden or shown as per UI)*

- **Batch ID:** n
- **Contextual Tags:** [Topic, Difficulty, Phase, UserPrefs, etc.]
- **Prior Batches Chosen Options:** [[MCQ\#1: C], [MCQ\#2: B], ...]
- **Timestamp**

```

### 3. Protocol Rules / Algorithm (Instructions, abstracted for AI or engineer)

**Step 1:**  
For requested topic/goal, identify 3–5 non-trivial junctures where user preference, strategy, or intuition meaningfully alters outcomes.  
**Step 2:**  
For each juncture, generate:  
  - MCQ phrased non-technically, describing the decision in familiar terms
  - 3–4 plausible, mutually distinct options (including low-level and high-level choices, attitude options, or "do nothing" as appropriate)
  - "Other / Custom" response option (mandatory)
**Step 3:**  
Present one batch at a time; let user select any number, answer out of order, add rationale/notes as desired  
**Step 4:**  
Upon user response, record:
  - Which option(s) selected per MCQ
  - All rationale, tangents, hesitations, and additional context
  - Store as structured batch result, append to cumulative protocol context
**Step 5:**  
Repeat generation of next MCQ batch, using accumulated user answers/context/tangents to inform and shape the next batch.
**Step 6:**  
At end (or at each major phase), surface a "context digest" summarizing all user intent, choices, and key signals for downstream execution (app build, technical handoff, further clarification).

### 4. Generalization and Extensibility

- Can be run via chat, UI forms, voice, touch, or other user interfaces.
- Can be extended for collaborative multi-user MCQ answering.
- Can be converted into an API protocol for AI-AI or AI-human workflows.
- Compatible with real-time, async, or hybrid decision-making.
- Integrates with domain-specific backend logic (e.g., code generation, app workflow synthesis) at the protocol's output boundary.

### 5. Protocol Example (Meta-Level)

#### (For illustration; actual batches will be domain/context generated.)

```


## Batch 1: Initial Design Preferences

MCQ1: What is your preferred approach for user interaction?

- [ ] A. Minimalist, text-focused
- [ ] B. Rich, graphical interface
- [ ] C. Mixed (text + graphics)
- [ ] Other / Custom: __________

Optional Rationale: ______________________

MCQ2: How much technical detail do you want to see?

- [ ] A. As little as possible, focus on outcome
- [ ] B. Key concepts only, no code
- [ ] C. Full technical transparency
- [ ] Other / Custom: __________

Optional Rationale: ______________________

...

```

### 6. Protocol Output

**At any point, the accumulated context =**  
All (MCQ, option, rationale, note) tuples  
+ all user-taken detours  
+ system-generated tags about process

### 7. Handoff and Instruction

> **To AI/Engineer/Builder:**  
Take this protocol template and instantiate it for your domain/use case.  
Generate batches of MCQs per above; adapt option wording and batch size to maximize user engagement and informational yield.  
Preserve *all* user-provided context.  
Signal completion with a context digest, outputting a structured summary suitable for technical synthesis, further AI processing, or app building.

# End of MCQ Nexus Protocol Template

**Summary**:  
This protocol is deliberate, explicit, messy-context tolerant, batch-structured, and universal. It serves both the needs of the non-technical decider and the requirements of technical systems—making the world, indeed, an MCQ.
